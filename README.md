## App Brainstorming
### 3 applications that I like:

1. Pinterest
   - Creating boards and adding pictures to those boards
   - Simple explore page catered to users likes

2. Here.fm
   - Connects multiple people into one customizable online room (video or audio call)
   - Customizable online rooms! (Embed pictures, songs, videos)

3. Notion
   - Many customizable widgets that help make things personalized
   - Simple UI, but a lot of options are available
