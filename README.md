### App Brainstorming
3 applications that I like:
1. Pinterest
   - Creating boards and adding pictures to those boards
   - Simple explore page catered to users likes

2. Here.fm
   - Customizable online rooms! (Embed pictures, songs, videos)
   - Very aesthetically catered to younger people

3. Notion
   - Many customizable widgets that help make things personalized
   - Simple UI, but a lot of options are available
  
App ideas: 
An app that generates a "main theme" for the day, depending on the user's mood
   - This would serve as a mood tracker and also a daily affirmations or to-do list for the user!
   - The user would be prompted to track their mood for the day, and a list of uplifting suggested activities could appear for the user.
   - Generating a moodboard or playlist could be a possibility too
   - Possibly include a small notes section for the user to document their day
   - Make it customizable like Here.fm or Notion
   - The motivation for this app is to help users self regulate when they need to
